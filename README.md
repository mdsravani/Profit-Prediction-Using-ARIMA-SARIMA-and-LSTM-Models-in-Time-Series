Profit Prediction Using ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM ðŸ§ ðŸ“ˆ
This project focuses on predicting business profits using Time Series Forecasting techniques. We implemented traditional statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and a deep learning model (LSTM) to analyze historical financial data and forecast future profits.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

Streamlit (for UI and real-time forecasting dashboard)

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

Preprocessing of financial datasets (handling missing data, normalization)

Comparative evaluation of forecasting models using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and RÂ²

LSTM model for capturing complex patterns and long-term dependencies

Interactive Streamlit app for visualization and predictions

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
LSTM outperformed traditional models in both accuracy and adaptability, proving more effective in predicting profits in dynamic business environments.

ðŸ“‚ Use Case:
Ideal for businesses aiming to enhance financial planning, risk management, and strategic decision-making through data-driven forecasts.
